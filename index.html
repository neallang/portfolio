            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Neal, a fourth-year student 
                studying computer science at the University of Virginia.
                My coding journey began when I took 'Introduction to 
                Programming' at UVA. While this was the hardest
                course I'd taken at the time, I found the assignments 
                extremely thought-provoking and rewarding. There's nothing
                like the feeling of figuring out a solution or bug after hours
                of grinding, and this exact feeling inspired me to become a 
                TA for the course the following semester. I now also lead a weekly
                lab of students and other TAs with the hopes of helping students 
                reach that 'Aha!' moment.
            </p>
            <p>Since then, I've seen success in programming both within and 
                beyond the classroom. I've been able to maintain a strong GPA while 
                balancing difficult course loads. Alongside my role as a TA, I also 
                had the opportunity to teach courses in Python and Java last summer. 
                More recently, I've found a passion for
                web development, and I've used my learned skills to help several 
                companies develop their websites and a mobile application. As I enjoy
                full-stack development, my objective
                is to help solve problems and ultimately bridge the gap between people
                and technology through user-friendly interfaces and experiences.
            </p>
            <p>If you're looking for a hard worker with strong communication skills
                to add to your team, or you're just looking for an extra set of eyes and 
                hands regarding a project, please reach out. Let's connect 
                and pursue exciting new opportunities!
